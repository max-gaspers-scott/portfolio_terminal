This is my web terminal emulator. 

right now it has hardcoded comands and acts as my peronal website. 

I plan to make a full ssh capible aplication and add VR suport.

Plan:

* use a websoket for to proxy for the xterm FE. (maybe add socket creatign to auto-rust)
* update the xterm FE to connect to the socket from the BE and display the output/send back the inputs
* use A-frame html-shader library to put it in vr

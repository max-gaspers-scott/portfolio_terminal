## this porject serves as my portfolio site. It links to my other work, have a chatbot that can anwer questions about me, and a web based terminal emulator for users
## that would like to use a comand line to read files about me


In addition to acting as my personal site I plan to add a full ssh capible web terminal aplication and add VR suport the lets me securly acsses a VM to run and right code (in neovim) from a VR headset.
* the current web terminal tab of this aplication will be a starting point for this.
* I am putton this here insted of in its own porject under a new domain name because it seams fitting to have an aplication ment just for me on my site. But I may change my mind.

Plan for real web terminal:

* use a websoket for to proxy for the xterm FE. (maybe add socket creatign to auto-rust)
* update the xterm FE to connect to the socket from the BE and display the output/send back the inputs
* use A-frame html-shader library to put it in vr
